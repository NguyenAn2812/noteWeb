The video should provide a brief overview of the technologies and architecture of the web application. Following this, the team must sequentially demonstrate each feature developed, based on the evaluation form containing 28 criteria. Any criteria not demonstrated in the video will be considered as not implemented, even if the group claims otherwise in their self-assessment form. The video must have a minimum resolution of 1080p, clear audio, and be easy to understand. If the video file is too large, the team should upload it to YouTube and include the link in the submission.
